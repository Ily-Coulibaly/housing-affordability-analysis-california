# Housing Affordability & Risk of Homelessness: The case of California

## Project Overview  

This project studies housing price trends in four of California's biggest cities, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, to better understand affordability challenges and the potential risk of homelessness in the state.  

The analysis covers historical housing prices from **2000 to 2024**, then extends the timeline by **predicting price trends for the next 5 years (2025–2029)**. By combining observed data with forecasts, the project evaluates whether stable housing in California is becoming more or less attainable for residents in the near future.

## Research Questions
- How have housing prices evolved across California's major cities (Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose)?  
- What are the projected home price trends for these cities over the next 5-10 years?
  
---

## Key Features

- Time-Series Analysis: Examines housing price data across four major California cities.  
- Comparative Trends: Highlights differences between coastal hubs and inland tech-driven markets.  
- Affordability Focus: Frames affordability as a proxy for homelessness risk.  
- Visualization: Produces charts and plots to illustrate housing dynamics clearly.

## Setup

To reproduce the analysis and forecasts, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/california-housing-crisis.git
   cd california-housing-crisis
````

2. **Install required dependencies**
   The analysis runs in Python 3. Install the following libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. **Open the notebook**
   Launch Jupyter and run the main notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Housing.ipynb
   ```

4. **Run the workflow**

   * Load the historical Zillow housing dataset (2000–2024).
   * Run the cleaning and exploratory analysis cells to view city-level price trends.
   * Execute the forecasting cells to generate **5-year projections (2025–2029)**.
   * Review the generated visualizations (line plots, comparison charts).

5. **Outputs generated**

   * Historical price trend plots for Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose.
   * Forecast plots extending the series to 2029.
   * Comparative graphs showing affordability pressures across cities.
