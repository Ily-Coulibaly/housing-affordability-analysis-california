# Housing Affordability & Risk of Homelessness - the case of California

This project studies housing price trends in four of California's biggest cities, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, to better understand affordability challenges and the potential risk of homelessness. By analyzing how prices have changed over time, the project asks whether stable housing in California is becoming more or less attainable for residents.

## Problem Statement  

California was selected for this study because it illustrates the housing crisis in its most extreme form. The state combines some of the nation’s highest home prices and rent burdens with one of the largest unhoused populations. Climate-related events like **wildfires and droughts** further destabilize local economies and compound the problem.  

Tracking housing prices over time provides insight into whether affordability pressures are easing or worsening, and what that means for the future risk of homelessness in California’s largest cities.
